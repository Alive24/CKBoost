# Milestone 1 Report for CKBoost

## Overview

CKBoost Milestone 1 delivers the bare bone framework for CKBoost, the gamified engagement platform on CKB testnet, implementing core smart contracts, dApp infrastructure, and essential user workflows. Additionally, the ckb_deterministic framework was developed to provide standardized smart contract validation patterns.

Notes: In milestone 1, we focus on delivering the bare bone framework of the project which involves a high level of interdependency between core modules of both smart contracts and dApp. As we progress to the next milestones, we will switch to issue based development and continuous delivery.

- ‚úÖ PRD-driven development methodology established
- ‚úÖ CKB Deterministic framework examples

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deferred Issues & New Todo Items

The following issues are deferred as they are not critical features at the moment but they will be registered as trackable issues.

### 1. Approve Completion - Status Check Commented Out

**File**: `/contracts/contracts/ckboost-campaign-type/src/recipes.rs`
**Content**:

```rust
// TODO: Not handling this for now
// // Verify campaign status is active (4)
// if input_campaign_data.status() != 4u8.into() {
//     debug!("Campaign is not active, status: {}", input_campaign_data.status());
//     return Err(DeterministicError::BusinessRuleViolation);
// }
```

**Issue**: Campaign status validation is disabled, allowing approval at any status.
**Status**: Deferred as only necessary for marginal cases.

### 2. Protocol Type - Timestamp

**File**: `/contracts/contracts/ckboost-protocol-type/src/recipes.rs`
**Content**:

```rust
// TODO: Implement proper timestamp retrieval from header deps
// TODO: Check expiration when we have proper timestamp access
```

**Issue**: Protocol timestamp is accurate and validated
**Status**: Deferred as only needed in tipping proposal and it is not a critical feature at the moment.

### 3. SSRI Server Error Reporting

**File**: Multiple service files in `/dapp/lib/services/`
**Issue**: When SSRI server is not ready, errors are generic.
**Status**: Deferred as implementations of executor is not confirmed yet and it shouldn't be sensible to generic users.

### 4. Re-funding after approval of campaign

**Issue**: After approval of campaign, the re-funding interface is not available yet.
**Status**: Deferred as it is not a critical feature at the moment.

### 5. Store Campaign cover with Nostr

**Issue**: Campaign cover should be stored on Nostr
**Status**: Deferred as it is not a critical feature at the moment.

### 6. Rewards stats for campaign detail page

**Issue**: It's getting the available rewards but not the distributed rewards.
**Status**: Deferred as it is not a critical feature at the moment.

### 7. Endorser info for campaigns

**Issue**: Endorser info is not showing up for campaigns.
**Status**: Deferred as it is not a critical feature at the moment.
