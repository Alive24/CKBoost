## Why?

Decentralized blockchains are fundamentally people-driven networks. It’s people that give a network its vitality, that transform ideas on a whitepaper to a tangible web of miners, developers, content creators, entrepreneurs, advocates, users and leaders. The future of this ecosystem lies in the hands of its supporters and participants.

The Nervos Foundation will eventually disband. The Nervos Community Catalyst will play its part to prepare for that reality and ensure the community is more autonomous and able to grow the ecosystem with more sense of independence.

## About

The Nervos Community Catalyst has been established by myself (Neon). I founded the Nervos Nation community group which is one of the main platforms for daily CKB-related discussion. Over the years I have been involved in content creation (Nervos Nation explainer videos), social media activity (All Things CKB Spaces and general X activism), as well as various community outreach and ecosystem growth initiatives.

As the founder and sole team member of Nervos Community Catalyst, it will be my responsibility to ensure the community is well-positioned to follow on from the Nervos Foundation, by creating roles for the community as listed below.

## Initiatives

There will be three key initiatives that form the main focus of the Nervos Community Catalyst. Over the coming weeks and months these initiatives will have their own threads and announcements, which will provide detailed information about activities and how to apply. It is planned that these initiatives will eventually be overseen and funded by the CKB Community DAO v2. Together, these initiatives provide “something for everyone” - an opportunity to participate suited to your desired level of commitment.

### 1. Community Keeps Building

An initiative with structured tracks for community members to contribute their efforts and be rewarded with microgrants. This is for community members who are interested in the following:

- Content creation
- CKB activism
- Building on CKB
- Creating a new community branch
- Leadership

Each category will have its own progress pathway and will have structured activities that a) meet a direct need of the community; or b) advance personal growth in a way that benefits the community.

In addition to a set progress pathway, there will be “bounty boards” that contain specific bounties for participants to claim. Importantly, this initiative is designed such that each category will produce graduates who collectively shape the direction and management of that pathway.

### 2. CKB Off-Chain

An initiative focusing on creating local CKB chapters across regions where community members are aggregated. This will fund and empower community members to set up their own meetings and events, potentially timed around local blockchain events conferences, with the following purposes:

- Foster stronger offline social connections within the CKB community of a specific region
- Onboard more local people into the CKB community, create social connections with people outside of the community and in other nearby crypto communities
- Increase “IRL” presence for CKB

Each chapter will have its own leader and its own budget depending on the size of the meetup. I am already talking to potential regional leads - if you are interested in setting something up in your region, feel free to reach out.

### 3. CKBoost

This initiative focuses on setting up structures whereby the community can be rewarded for participating in more trivial tasks such as sharing content, posting comments, participating in campaigns under a “proof of participation” quest platform. Tasks can form part of specific campaigns aimed at addressing a specific time-sensitive need (e.g. raiding an X post) or addressing an area of low activity (e.g. reply to DAO proposals). Other such campaigns may include rewards for on-chain or chain-related activity (e.g. deposit liquidity to DEX, mint iCKB or RUSD, run a CKB node).

A leaderboard will aggregate points from campaigns and daily activities with top participants earning CKB rewards and small rewards issued randomly to any participant.

A cross-platform tipping bot is also considered here: if a user makes a valuable contribution, the community can reward them by initiating a CKB tip. Example rules, must be initiated by a user on the allowlist (e.g. leadership pathway member) and supported (thumbs-up’ed) by 3 other community members, upon which the bot automatically tips the desired recipient. Max 3 tips per month.

## Conclusion

These initiatives give you - the community - the freedom to play a greater role in the destiny of CKB; empowering you to create your own stories and achievements, and become the future pioneers of the network. The future is in your hands!

More information on all of the above initiatives will be released in due course. In the meantime, LFG CKB!
