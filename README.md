# CKBoost - Gamified Community Engagement Platform

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is currently under active development as part of the Nervos Community Catalyst initiative and is not yet ready for production use.

A purpose-built open-source gamified engagement platform for the CKB ecosystem, designed to transform community engagement from scattered, ad-hoc efforts into a structured, rewarding, and measurable system that drives participation, incentivizes real contributions, and encourages ecosystem growth.

## 🎯 Mission

CKBoost directly supports the goals of the [Nervos Community Catalyst](https://talk.nervos.org/t/nervos-community-catalyst/8128) initiative by providing the technical backbone for:

- **Structured Engagement**: Transform random community efforts into organized campaigns with clear goals
- **Verifiable Contributions**: Implement "proof of participation" for all types of community activities
- **Fair Rewards**: Distribute on-chain rewards transparently based on actual contributions
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Drive both off-chain engagement and on-chain activity through gamification

## 🌟 Overview

CKBoost addresses key challenges in community management:

- **Inclusive Participation**: Reward community members who don't have directly transferable skills for formal tracks
- **Synergized Effort**: Coordinate community action across social media, off-chain, and on-chain platforms
- **Fun & Incentivized**: Create enthusiasm for participation through gamification and rewards
- **On-Chain Activity**: Leverage CKB features and encourage more blockchain interaction

### Key Features

- **Campaign & Quest Management**: Multi-task campaigns with detailed quests, success metrics, and fully funded reward pools
- **On-Chain Points & Badges**: All achievements tracked via dedicated UDT for transparent rewards
- **Gamification Elements**: Streak bonuses, difficulty multipliers, dynamic leaderboards, and badge milestones
- **Anti-Sybil Verification**: Flexible verification starting with manual Telegram proof, expanding to DID/KYC
- **Community Tipping**: Peer recognition system with democratic approval flow and automated payouts
- **Comprehensive Dashboards**: Tools for campaign creators, admins, and reviewers to monitor progress

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ with **pnpm**
- **Rust** toolchain for contract development
- **CKB Node** for blockchain interaction (development/testnet)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alive24/CKBoost.git
   cd CKBoost
   ```

2. **Start the frontend application**
   ```bash
   cd dapp
   pnpm install
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Build smart contracts** (optional for frontend development)
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   make build
   ```

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Decentralized Design Philosophy

CKBoost implements a new pattern of decentralization for dApps:

- **Anyone-Can-Host Backend**: All backend services use open-source Cloudflare Workers that anyone can deploy
- **Trustless Operation**: No reliance on any single, centralized operator
- **Community Infrastructure**: Campaign sponsors and community members can host their own services
- **Resilient Network**: Multiple interoperable services instead of single points of failure

### Technology Stack

#### Frontend (dApp)

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React Context with CKB CCC integration
- **Wallet Integration**: @ckb-ccc/connector-react for universal wallet support
- **Data Layer**: Abstracted service layer supporting mock and blockchain data

#### Smart Contracts

- **ckboost-protocol-type**: Governance & Points UDT minting
- **ckboost-protocol-lock**: Protocol governance and treasury management
- **ckboost-campaign-type**: Campaign logic and quest management
- **ckboost-campaign-lock**: Secure vaults for campaign funds
- **ckboost-user-type**: Submission, verification, and social bindings

#### Decentralized API Services

- **Infrastructure**: Open-source Cloudflare Workers
- **Hosting**: By campaign sponsors and community members
- **Purpose**: Indexing, proof validation, and coordination

#### Data Storage Strategy

- **Critical State**: CKB Cell data for all on-chain states
- **Non-Critical Data**: Anyone-can-host Neon storage for submissions
- **Performance**: Local cache for fee optimization

## 📋 Core User Flows

### Campaign Creation Flow
Define quests → Fund campaign → Set proof requirements → Get admin approval → Launch → Monitor submissions → Distribute rewards

### Contributor Flow
Connect wallet → Browse campaigns → Complete tasks → Submit proof → Pass verification → Claim rewards → Earn badges & ranking

### Tipping Flow
Propose tip → Receive 5 peer approvals → Automated treasury payout → Permanent profile record

### Admin Flow
Identity verification → Campaign sponsor verification → Campaign approval → Base campaign creation

## 🎮 Example Campaign Types

- **AMA Boost**: Points for questions, shares, and Nervos discussion amplification
- **Knowledge Boost**: Share and summarize Knowledge Base articles
- **On-Chain Quests**: Lock CKB for iCKB, add DEX liquidity, interact with DeFi
- **Community Governance**: Engage with proposals and provide feedback

## 🔐 Security & Risk Management

### Security Measures

- **Escrow Protection**: Campaign lock scripts protect all escrowed assets
- **Multi-Signature**: Support for high-value campaign management
- **Time Locks**: Campaign duration enforcement and deadline management
- **Gradual Rollout**: Small initial contract funds with progressive scaling

### Anti-Sybil Protection

- **Locked Rewards**: Rewards remain locked until verification passes
- **Multi-Method Verification**: Telegram, DID, KYC, and manual review options
- **Reputation System**: Build trust through consistent participation
